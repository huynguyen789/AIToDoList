# AI Todo List Web App - Project Plan

## Overview

A modern todo list application with AI features, priority management based on the Eisenhower Matrix, and score tracking.

Todo:

* [X] Add time deadline on the task
* [X] The change pirority: it's a big long and not nice. Think of some way to make it nicely and shorter.
* [X] UI Improvements
  * [X] Add tooltips for better user guidance
  * [X] Improve empty state display in Eisenhower Matrix
  * [X] Fix duplicate heading issue
  * [X] Make the matrix use full screen width

Core:

* [X] Different to do list

  * [X] Life
  * [X] Work
  * [X] Project



* [X] *** Some how i can use on the website: database, log in? (In Progress) - Mar 1

  * [X] Firebase setup for authentication and database
  * [X] User authentication UI (login/register)
  * [X] Database integration for task persistence
  * [X] Complete testing and deployment



Mar1:

- [X] Restart, lost all task - Fixed by improving localStorage handling and adding proper error handling
- [ ] deployment
- [ ] Organize documentation: remove recent change.


* [ ] AI auto set priority ***

  * [ ] 1 most important long term goal
  * [ ] 3-5 most important goals this year
* [ ] Score tracking system: day week month year

  * [ ] Visual
* [ ] Reward system

  * [ ] Visual
* [ ] Leader board

  * [ ] Visual

Nice to have:

- [ ] Repetitive U+I and U+I
- [ ] Also dont have to show the score there for each task. Just show it in the top of each box for each type of task.

**Additional Feature Ideas**

* Time blocking integration to help users allocate focused time
* Habit formation elements for recurring tasks
* Weekly/monthly review prompts to help users reflect on productivity
* Optional integration with calendar systems
